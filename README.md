## Objectives
From the prespective of risk management of customer, identify the fraud commited by credit card payment and identify the model for which transaction are most likely to fraudulent or not. this is the crucial problem in finance sector need to overcome by predicting the model.

## Project Description

**credit_card_fraud_prediction_capstone_project** - It include the required function to train the model and predict the transaction are fraudulent or not.

**Technical_documentation** - It include the necessary documentation in the project.

## Logistic Regresssion
it is classification algorithm which predict the probability of outcome that can only have two values 0 and 1 and it produce logistic curve or s-shape curve which limited to value between 0 and 1. we can use lostic regression for binary classification we use sigmoidal function 1/1+e^-x to introduce non linearity in the data.
We use max likelihood and gradient descent as a optimizer algorithm to train logistic regression classifier.

**Matrix Evaluation** 
**1.Confusion matrix** – It is 2 X 2 matrix to which contain True positive, False positive, True Negative, False Negative. A confusion matrix is a table that is used to describe the performance of a classification model on test data.

**2.Accuracy** : the proportion of the total number of predictions that were correct.

**3.Precision** – It tells how precise and the quality of a positive prediction made by model. Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions

**4.Recall** - The ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a data set. recall means the percentage of correctly identified sample from all of the given data.

**5.F1-Score** - the F1 score conveys the balance between the precision and the recall in the binary classification. The F1 Score is the 2*((precision*recall)/(precision+recall)).
